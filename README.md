# Thematic Markov Chain Text Generator

## Description
The Thematic Markov Chain Text Generator is a multi-threaded application designed to generate text based on a given corpus. It employs a Markov chain model that incorporates keyword bias and synonym usage to create coherent text sequences. This project leverages advanced features such as arena allocation for memory management, string interning to optimize memory usage, and supports a variety of configuration options for fine-tuning the text generation process.

## Features
- **Multi-threaded corpus training**: Processes large text files efficiently by utilizing multiple threads.
- **Keyword-biased generation**: Allows users to specify keywords for generating thematic text.
- **Synonym support**: Enhances generated text by including synonyms related to specified keywords.
- **Customizable generation parameters**: Users can set parameters such as minimum and maximum text length, temperature for creativity, and repetition penalties.
- **Storage of generated candidates**: Archives generated sequences and selects the best candidates based on various scoring criteria.

## Installation and Setup
To build and run the project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., `gcc`).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
3. Compile the source code:
   ```bash
   gcc -o markov main.c -lpthread -lm
   ```
4. Prepare a text file (`corpus.txt`) as your input corpus and an optional synonyms file (`synonyms.txt`).

## Basic Usage
Run the program with the required input file and optional arguments for verbosity and random seed:
```bash
./markov corpus.txt --verbose 1 --seed 42
```
Follow the interactive prompts to input keywords, specify the generation length, and choose a starting context.

## Configuration
The application supports several configurable parameters:
- **Input file**: The text corpus from which the model is trained.
- **Output file**: Where to save the generated text (default is stdout).
- **Synonyms file**: Contains groups of synonyms for enhancing the generation.
- **Min/Max generation length**: Users can specify the minimum and maximum limits for generated text length.
- **Temperature**: Affects creativity during text generation; higher values produce more varied text.
- **Repetition penalty**: Controls how much to penalize repeated words in the generated output.

### Environment Variables
The program does not use environment variables but allows configuration through command line arguments.
